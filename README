 Vimlike Smooziee

THE BETA README FOR THE BETA VERSION.

the beta version has much more features, under very hot development, maybe it's not stable enough. but I will try to keep the code stable, because I use the beta version every day ;)

( but it's won't be auto updated,so maybe you need to install it by youself after every time I commited if you want to always keep it up to date. )

you can install the `more stable version/auto updated version/less features version` from here.
