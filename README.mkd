  * Vrome's icon would be show on the right of main Google Chrome toolbar after install
  * Click on the icon you would get a popup, click "Option" to navigate to Vrome's option page
  * In the option page, you could save your config in the textarea we provided. even upload your config to a remote server, then import the config automatically from the url. It would be useful if you have multiple computers. (I uploaded my config to [github](https://raw.github.com/jinzhu/configure/master/.vromerc))
