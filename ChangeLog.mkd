1.0 (2012/01/01)

- The first public and stable release after two more years of development!

  We did a big improve in this release, so suggest you read the README again.

  But I would like to list some changed hotkey here:
    `d` is not supported to close current now. use `dc` for that.
    `Esc` can't be used to re-enable Vrome after disabled it with <C-z>. use `<C-Esc>` (Control+Esc) for that.
